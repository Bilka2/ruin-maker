# Ruin maker

Generates ruin files for [The Ruins Mod](https://github.com/Bilka2/AbandonedRuins) from setups selected in-game. The ruin selection tool can be obtained from the shortcut bar.

Left-click and drag with the tool to select blueprintable tiles and entity. Shift + Left-click and drag to select all tiles and entities (includes e.g. water or trees).
After finishing the selection, a window is shown that allows to configure what exactly is included in the resulting ruin. After this GUI is closed by confirming, the ruin is output to a file in script-output/ruins in the [user data directory](https://wiki.factorio.com/User_data_directory).<br>
The ruins generated by this mod can be used directly for [custom ruin sets](https://github.com/Bilka2/AbandonedRuins/blob/master/docs/ruin_sets.md) for 'The Ruins Mod' or you can contribute them directly to [the ruins mod](https://github.com/Bilka2/AbandonedRuins/blob/master/docs/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
